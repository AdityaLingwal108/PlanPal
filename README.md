# PlanPal
PlanPal is a mobile-friendly web app that helps people decide what to do and where to hang out, whether you’re solo and indecisive or planning with a group of friends. Instead of arguing, overthinking, or waiting for someone to take charge, PlanPal makes the decision process simple, democratic, and stress free.
